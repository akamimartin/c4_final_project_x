      <p>  "Hey Jade, you got everything?" My mom baked us cake and made ham sandwiches, "said Sade, holding up a big paper bag. "Did you bring the rake, tape and the shovel."
       "YUP", said Jade, a tall skinny boy with red hair.  Sade looked at Jade's small shovel and the old rake that seem to be missing teeth at the end. 
       Shaking her head, Sade pulled out her neatly drawn map and showed it to Jade. "If we go towards Flames End and turn right at the grape vines, we should come to where there is a gape in the rocks and bushes.  We have five hours before the tide rises.
          With Sade taking two steps to keep pace with Jade's long strides, they left the paved road and headed down the dusty path toward Flames End.  "You're sure this is the right way," said Jade as they came to a split in the road, the road now divided into two roads, both look the same, dusty and bumpy.  
          Craning her neck to see as far as she could down both roads,  Sadie hesitated for 5 seconds, then she gazed to the right fork, "lets go this way" it leads towards the ocean.  "Are you sure, I thought we had to turn right at the grape vine and I know that goes inland a little, to be honest, I feel like I'm in a maze with no cave in site"

          "I'm sure," said Sade, taking two steps down the right lane" "Ok, you lead, said Jade, but my stomach is noisy."  "it should only take 10 more minutes till we find Flames End said Sade"

          "See I told you, only ten minutes more", said Sade, pointing to a gate that had the words "Flames End" scraped on it.

          Swinging the gate opened, Sade and Jade headed towards
          the grape vines.  Finaly reaching the grape vines,   Jade and Sade sat down under a big oak tree that gave lots of shade.  Taking the paper plates out of the bag first, Sade placed a sandwich and a piece of cake on each plate and handed a plate to Jade.

          "Hey Sade when it's my birthday can you ask you're mom to bake my cake?" Jade's dad was not much of a baker and it just the two of them at home. His mom was in Cape Town for one year doing research on African apes.
          Mouth full of cake, Sade just nodded.

          Close to the beach, Jade and Sade could make out the outlines of a cave at the far side of the beach.  Putting the garbage in the bag, Sade and Jade headed towards the cave.

          "See, I told you we'd find it," said Sade as she made her way through the bush and rocks that was infront of the cave.  All of a sudden, Sade became completely still, motioning to Jade to go backwards slowly.
