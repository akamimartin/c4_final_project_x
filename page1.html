      <p>Hey Jade, you got everything?" My mom baked us cake and made ham sandwiches, "said Sade, holding up a big paper bag. "Did you bring the rake, tape and the shovel."
       "YUP", said Jade, a tall skinny boy with red hair.  Sade looked at Jade's small shovel and the old rake that seem to be missing teeth at the end. 
       Shaking her head, Sade pulled out her neatly drawn map and showed it to Jade. "If we go towards Flames End and turn right at the grape vines, we should come to where there is a gape in the rocks and bushes.  We have five hours before the tide rises and the waves will rush in.
       With Sade taking two steps to keep pace with Jade's long strides, they left the paved road and headed down the dusty path toward Flames End.  "You're sure this is the right way," said Jade as they came to a split in the road, the road now divided into two roads, both look the same, dusty and bumpy.  </p>

       <p> Craning her neck to see as far as she could down both roads,  Sadie hesitated for 5 seconds, then she gazed to the right fork, "lets go this way" it leads towards the ocean.  "Are you sure, I thought we had to turn right at the grape vine and I know that goes inland a little, to be honest, I feel like I'm in a maze with no cave in site"
       "I'm sure," said Sade, taking two steps down the right lane" "Ok, you lead, said Jade, but my stomach is noisy."  "it should only take 10 more minutes till we find Flames End said Sade"</p>
