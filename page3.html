 <p> Using the rake, Sade pushed back the overgrown bush to create an opening in the cave. Taking the flash light out of her pocket,  Sade entered the cave with Jade following behind with the shovel in his hand, ready to strike at anything.

       The only sounds in the cave were their footsteps and what sounded like small drops of water.  The sides of the cave were lined with big boulders.  It looked like others had been there before them, there were the remains of a fire.  Walking deeper into the cave, the sounds of water were getting louder. The walls seem to vibrate.  Jade had to stoop now, the further they went in the cave, the lower the ceiling of the cave became.  </p>


       <p> For once being short was a good thing, Sade thought to herself.
        The water was getting louder, Sade turned a sharp corner and came to an abrupt stop staring straigth ahead looking completely amazed, causing Jade to smash right into her, banging his head on the ceiling of the cave. 
        "Ouch," said Jade as he rubbed his head, "that hurt" looking passed Sade, he know right away, why she stopped.  Infront of  
        them was a lake with crystal clear water and a waterfall that Jade calculated as four stories high.  
        "On the count of three, one, two, three", Jade and Sade both jumped in, making big splashes. 
        "This is awesome," said Jade splashing Sade.  They were having so much fun, that they did not hear the sound at first,  it was like a low moaning sound that was getting louder.  Jade stopped first,  Sade now heard it too.  It was getting closer.</p>


       <p>
        "We need to make a run for it," said Jade as he and Sade got out of the lake as fast as they could, Sade grabbed the flashlight, and Jade grabbed the shovel and they ran as fast as they could, the sound was right behind them now. The moan was getting louder the sounds were vibrating off the walls.

        Once out of the cave Jade and Sade continued running,  not caring of the bushes and rocks that scraped against their legs and arms.    Gasping for air, both Jade and Sade leaned against the big oak tree that they had lunch at earlier.  Looking back everything looked normal.  They could no longer hear the shrill moaning.  "Come on, let's keep walking," said Sade, as she heading toward the gate at Flames End.  Jade kept pace with her, shorting his strides.  "What do think that was?"
        ask Jade.  "Not sure, but it hurt my ears and scared me to death",  "We have to go back," said Jade.
        "Are you crazy?",  First the biggest rattlesnake ever, then that sound, what will be next'.  " said Sade.
        "I hear ya, but aren't you curious"
        "yeah",  but I need time to recuperate, my heart is still racing.  
        "Ok, but this isn't the end of it," said Jade as they both picked up the pace to hurry home.</p>
