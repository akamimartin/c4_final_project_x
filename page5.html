        "We need to make a run for it," said Jade as he and Sade got out of the lake as fast as they could, Sade grabbed the flashlight, and Jade grabbed the shovel and they ran as fast as they could, the sound was right behind them now. The moan was getting louder the sounds were vibrating off the walls.

        Once out of the cave Jade and Sade continued running,  not caring of the bushes and rocks that scraped against their legs and arms.    Gasping for air, both Jade and Sade leaned against the big oak tree that they ate earlier.  Looking back everything looked normal.  They could no longer hear the shrill moaning.  "Come on, let's keep walking," said Sade, as she heading toward the gate at Flames End.  Jade kept pace with her, shorting his strides.  "What do think that was?"
        ask Jade.  "Not sure, but it hurt my ears and scared me to death",  "We have to go back," said Jade.
        "Are you crazy?",  First the biggest rattlesnake ever, then that sound, what will be next'.  " said Sade.
        "I hear ya, but aren't you curious"
        "yeah",  but I need time to recuperate, my heart is still racing.  
        "Ok, but this isn't the end of it," said Jade as they both picked up the pace to hurry home.</p>
