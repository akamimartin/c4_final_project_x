<p> Craning her neck to see as far as she could down both roads,  Sadie hesitated for 5 seconds, then she gazed to the right fork, "lets go this way" it leads towards the ocean.  "Are you sure, I thought we had to turn right at the grape vine and I know that goes inland a little, to be honest, I feel like I'm in a maze with no cave in site"
           "I'm sure," said Sade, taking two steps down the right lane" "Ok, you lead, said Jade, but my stomach is noisy."  "it should only take 10 more minutes till we find Flames End said Sade"</p>  
      
      <p>"See I told you, only ten minutes more", said Sade, pointing to a gate that had the words "Flames End" scraped on it.

      Swinging the gate opened, Sade and Jade headed towards
      the grape vines.  Finaly reaching the grape vines,   Jade and Sade sat down under a big oak tree that gave lots of shade.  Taking the paper plates out of the bag first, Sade placed a sandwich and a piece of cake on each plate and handed a plate to Jade. </p>
