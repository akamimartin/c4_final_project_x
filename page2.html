         <p> Craning her neck to see as far as she could down both roads,  Sadie hesitated for 5 seconds, then she gazed to the right fork, "lets go this way" it leads towards the ocean.  "Are you sure, I thought we had to turn right at the grape vine and I know that goes inland a little, to be honest, I feel like I'm in a maze with no cave in site"
           "I'm sure," said Sade, taking two steps down the right lane" "Ok, you lead, said Jade, but my stomach is noisy."  "it should only take 10 more minutes till we find Flames End said Sade"</p>  
      
      <p>"See I told you, only ten minutes more", said Sade, pointing to a gate that had the words "Flames End" scraped on it.

      Swinging the gate opened, Sade and Jade headed towards
      the grape vines.  Finaly reaching the grape vines,   Jade and Sade sat down under a big oak tree that gave lots of shade.  Taking the paper plates out of the bag first, Sade placed a sandwich and a piece of cake on each plate and handed a plate to Jade.

      "Hey Sade when it's my birthday can you ask you're mom to bake my cake?" Jade's dad was not much of a baker and it just the two of them at home. His mom was in Cape Town for one year doing research on African apes.
      Mouth full of cake, Sade just nodded. </p>

      <p>Close to the beach, Jade and Sade could make out the outlines of a cave at the far side of the beach.  Placing the garbage in the bag, Sade and Jade headed towards the cave.

       "See, I told you we'd find it," said Sade as she made her way through the bush and rocks that was infront of the cave.  All of a sudden, Sade's face became as pale as a ghost, she became completely still.  Jade knew at once, what it was, he could hear it.  Slowly he made his way past Sade, telling her under his breath to be brave. Lefting his shovel as slowly as possible, in a flash he brought the shovel down on the snake, slicing the snake in half.  Shaking, Sade scraped her leg on a rock as she collapsed on the dirt.  "Man, that rattle was so loud, I'm gonna have nigtmares about that," said Sade as she dusted off herself and stood up.  
      "Yeah, that was close,"said Jade as he exhaled slowed.  He picked up the snake with the shovel and tossed the snake as far as he could in the deep bush.</p>
