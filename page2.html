<p> Looking to see as far as she could down both roads,  Kate stopped for five seconds,"let's go this way. It goes to the grapevine. </p>

 <p>"Are you sure? 

<p>"I'm sure," said Kate, taking two steps down the dirt road.</p>
<p> "Ok, you lead," said Jade, "but my stomach is getting noisy."</p>

 <p>"It should only take ten more minutes till we find Flame End," said Kate.</p>  
      
<p>"See I told you,"  said Kate, pointing to a gate that had the words "Flame End" on it.</p>

<p>Swinging the gate open, Kate and Jade made a right to the grapevine.  Reaching the grapevine, Jade and Kate sat down under a big oak tree that gave lots of shade.</p>

<p>Taking the paper plates out of the bag, Kate placed a sandwich and a piece of cake on each plate and handed a plate to Jade. </p>
